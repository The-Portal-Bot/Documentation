## How do I communicate with portal

You can interact with portal only via a text channel.
Portal **does not** resposd to private messages. You
can make a request (command) by typing your prefix followed
by the command as follows `./help`.

## [Commands](commands/description)

Portal has many different commands, which doing something different.
There commands such as *weather* that replies with weather data, and there
are commands as *music* that have a lasting effect as it spawns a music
channel. *To see the full list of commands click [here](commands).*

## [Text Interpreter](interpreter/description)

Text Interpreter is a program used by Portal when asked to generate
a channel name. For example if you have set your voices name to
`./set v.regex $status_list` portal knows thats `status_list` is a 
variable, as it is proceded by the symbol _$_  (portal can read variables,
attributes, pipes and structures as seen bellow).<br />
So lets say you are playing Counter Strike, your channel's name will be
__CS:GO__.
