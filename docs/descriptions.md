## How do I communicate with portal

You can interact with portal only via a text channel.
Portal **does not** resposd to private messages. You
can make a request (command) by typing your prefix followed
by the command as follows `./help`.

## [Commands](commands/description)

Portal has many different commands, with many different functions.
From commands that inform you about real world data to commands
such as *music* that have a lasting effect as it spawns a music
channel.<br />
*To see the full list of commands click [here](commands/description).*

## [Text Interpreter](interpreter/description)

Text Interpreter is a program used by Portal when asked to generate
a channel name. For example if you have set your voices name to
`./set v.regex $status_list` portal knows thats `status_list` is a 
variable, as it is proceded by the symbol _$_  (portal can read variables,
attributes, pipes and structures as seen bellow).<br />
So lets say you are playing Counter Strike, your channel's name will be
__CS:GO__.<br />

## [Ranking System](ranking)

Portal's leveling system tracks messages sent and minutes spent in server's
voice channels. Different actions ammount to different points that give you
levels which then give you roles.<br />
