## Examples

- Lets say you want to create a new ranking system for your server, you would type

  ```json
  ./set_ranks [
      {
          "level": "10",
          "role": "newbie"
      },
      {
          "level": "100",
          "role": "admin"
      }
  ]
  ```

  This would create a ranking system by which you would be given role `newbie` when reaching level `10` and `admin` at level `100`.√ç
