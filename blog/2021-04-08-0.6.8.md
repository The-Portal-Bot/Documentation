NEW spamming implementation written from scratch<br />
NEW spamming penalties (warn, mute, kick and ban members automatically)<br />
NEW attribute [g.mute_role](/docs/interpreter/objects/attributes/detailed/global/g.mute_role)

:::note

_for now Portal will not kick nor ban members as after_ban and after_kick properties
will be transformed to global attributes, to be set by admins in a per-server manner_

:::
